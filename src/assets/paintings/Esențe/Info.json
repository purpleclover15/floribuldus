  "description": "The painting ‘Essences’ by Flori Bulduș is an invitation to self-discovery.\n\nThis work suggests the idea of inner richness gradually revealed through the flow of golden sap. Created in warm tones, it aims to remind us of our roots and their abundance.\n\nEach painting in the ‘Sap of Life’ series tells a unique story. This piece encourages the viewer to see themselves in the concept of the tree, with the resin symbolizing each person’s spiritual wealth. With every glance, we are reminded that there is a deep and valuable side of our personality that we must reveal to the world.\n\nThis painting is a captivating piece for those who seek to bring to light the best aspects of their being. ‘Essences’ can be not just an artwork, but a mirror for each individual.",
